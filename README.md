Yet Another Wine GUI (Yawg) is a simple prototype GUI-based application. It's original purpose was to allow access to Wine functions and applications without having to use the CLI.

Yawg is written in Mono and GTK 2.x using Stetic, a Windows Forms-like GUI builder built into MonoDevelop.

The project was a prototype as much as it was a learning exercise for me to familiarize myself with Mono tools on Linux but also GUI development and GUI builders. As such, this project has reach its end of life and will not be updated.

Takeaways from this project:

* I loathe GUI builders
* I don't particularly like using Mono/C# for personal projects
* MonoDevelop is possibly the best/most powerful IDE for Linux, however it's Git integration is terrible

The original purpose of Yawg will likely be rewritten into a new application that doesn't use a GUI builder.
